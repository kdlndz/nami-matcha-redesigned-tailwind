NAMI MATCHA (Redesigned) Upgraded using Tailwind

This is another old project from my CodePen.io account that I'm upgrading to Tailwind.
I did this redesigning project after seeing one my favorite YouTuber, Ashley, launched her matcha business. While her current website is looking great, I noticed some small details that need to be polished to give her supporters and buyers the best UX experience while purchasing their matcha!

I will get back into this documentation when I finish the upgraded version.

2nd day of upgrading Nami Matcha Redesigned.
At the moment, I am having troubles with transition, finding which div to add the padding and margin, and aligning links.

Today I finished upgrading my old css into tailwind.
I also added a simple transition effect in the product section.

One of the issues I encountered was making the grid, but with the help of auto-col-max,  auto-rows and grid-flow-col, I fixed it in no time.

I very much enjoy the transition effect in the product section.
I used inset and group it to achieve this.

Keeping the docs open and looking up the errors I need to fix also  helped me in this assignment.
